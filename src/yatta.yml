    summary: >-
      We agree with Lake and colleagues on their list of key ingredients for
      building humanlike intelligence, including the idea that model-based
      reasoning is essential. However, we favor an approach that centers on one
      additional ingredient: autonomy. In particular, we aim toward agents that
      can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human
      hand-engineering. We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning
      has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world
      complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not
      available. Here we survey several important examples of the progress that
      has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities,
      and highlight some outstanding challenges.
